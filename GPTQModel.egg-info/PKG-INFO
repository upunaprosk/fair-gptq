              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Three line api to use `GPT-QModel` for gptq model inference:

```py
from gptqmodel import GPTQModel

model = GPTQModel.load("ModelCloud/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-gptqmodel-4bit-vortex-v2.5")
result = model.generate("Uncovering deep insights begins with")[0] # tokens
print(model.tokenizer.decode(result)) # string output
```

To use models from [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/) instead of HuggingFace Hub, set an environment variable:
```shell
export GPTQMODEL_USE_MODELSCOPE=True
```
```py
from gptqmodel import GPTQModel
# load Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4 from modelscope
model = GPTQModel.load("Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4")
result = model.generate("Uncovering deep insights begins with")[0] # tokens
print(model.tokenizer.decode(result)) # string output
```

### OpenAI API compatible end-point
```py
# load model using above inference guide first
model.serve(host="0.0.0.0",port="12345")
```

### Quantization
Basic example of using `GPT-QModel` to quantize a llm model:

```py
from datasets import load_dataset
from gptqmodel import GPTQModel, QuantizeConfig

model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct"
quant_path = "Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-gptqmodel-4bit"

calibration_dataset = load_dataset(
    "allenai/c4",
    data_files="en/c4-train.00001-of-01024.json.gz",
    split="train"
  ).select(range(1024))["text"]

quant_config = QuantizeConfig(bits=4, group_size=128)

model = GPTQModel.load(model_id, quant_config)

# increase `batch_size` to match gpu/vram specs to speed up quantization
model.quantize(calibration_dataset, batch_size=1)

model.save(quant_path)
```

### Quantization using GPTAQ (Experimental, not MoE compatible, and results may not be better than v1)

Enable GPTAQ quantization by setting `v2 = True`.
```py
# Note v2 is currently experimental, not MoE compatible, and requires 2-4x more vram to execute
# We have many reports of v2 not working better or exceeding v1 so please use for testing only
# If oom on 1 gpu, please set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 to 2 gpu and gptqmodel will auto use second gpu
quant_config = QuantizeConfig(bits=4, group_size=128, v2=True)
```
`Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct` quantized using `test/models/test_llama3_2.py`

| Method | Bits/Group Size | ARC_CHALLENGE   | GSM8K_Platinum_COT | 
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| GPTQ   | 4 / 128         | 49.15           | 48.30              |
| GPTAQ  | 4 / 128         | 49.74  +1.20%   | 61.46  +27.25%     |
| GPTQ   | 3 / 128         | 39.93           | 43.26              |
| GPTAQ  | 3 / 128         | 41.13  +3.01%   | 50.54  +16.83%     | 

# Quantization Inference
```py
# test post-quant inference
model = GPTQModel.load(quant_path)
result = model.generate("Uncovering deep insights begins with")[0] # tokens
print(model.tokenizer.decode(result)) # string output
```

### Quantization + EoRA Accuracy Recovery 

GPT-QModel now support EoRA, a LoRA method that can further imporve the accuracy of the quantized model
```py
# higher rank improves accuracy at the cost of vram usage
# suggestion: test rank 64 and 32 before 128 or 256 as latter may overfit while increasing memory usage
eora = Lora(
  # for eora generation, path is adapter save path; for load, it is loading path
  path=f"{quant_path}/eora_rank32", 
  rank=32,
)

# provide a previously gptq quantized model path
GPTQModel.adapter.generate(
  adapter=eora,
  model_id_or_path=model_id,
  quantized_model_id_or_path=quant_path,
  calibration_dataset=calibration_dataset,
  calibration_dataset_concat_size=0,
)

# post-eora inference
model = GPTQModel.load(
  model_id_or_path=quant_path,
  adapter=eora
)

tokens = model.generate("Capital of France is")[0]
result = model.tokenizer.decode(tokens)

print(f"Result: {result}")
# For more detail of EoRA please see GPTQModel/examples/eora
# Please use the benchmark tools in later part of this README to evaluate EoRA effectiveness
```

### How to Add Support for a New Model

Read the [`gptqmodel/models/llama.py`](https://github.com/ModelCloud/GPTQModel/blob/5627f5ffeb3f19b1a2a97e3b6de6fbe668b0dc42/gptqmodel/models/llama.py) code which explains in detail via comments how the model support is defined. Use it as guide to PR for to new models. Most models follow the same pattern.

### Evaluation and Quality Benchmarks

GPTQModel inference is integrated into both [lm-eval](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) and [evalplus](https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus)  
We highly recommend avoid using `ppl` and use `lm-eval`/`evalplus` to validate post-quantization model quality. `ppl` should only be used for regression tests and is not a good indicator of model output quality.  

```
# gptqmodel is integrated into lm-eval >= v0.4.7
pip install lm-eval>=0.4.7
```

```
# gptqmodel is integrated into evalplus[main]
pip install -U "evalplus @ git+https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus"
```

Below is a basic sample using `GPTQModel.eval` API

```py
from gptqmodel import GPTQModel
from gptqmodel.utils.eval import EVAL

model_id = "ModelCloud/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-gptqmodel-4bit-vortex-v1"

# Use `lm-eval` as framework to evaluate the model
lm_eval_data = GPTQModel.eval(model_id, 
                    framework=EVAL.LM_EVAL, 
                    tasks=[EVAL.LM_EVAL.ARC_CHALLENGE])


# Use `evalplus` as framework to evaluate the model
evalplus_data = GPTQModel.eval(model_id, 
                    framework=EVAL.EVALPLUS, 
                    tasks=[EVAL.EVALPLUS.HUMAN])

```
### Dynamic Quantization (Per Module QuantizeConfig Override)

`QuantizeConfig.dynamic` is dynamic control which allows specific matching `modules` to be skipped for quantization (negative matching)
or have a unique `[bits, group_size, sym, desc_act, mse, pack_dtype]` property override per matching `module` vs base `QuantizeConfig` (postive match with override). 

Sample `QuantizerConfig.dynamic` usage:

```py
dynamic = { 
    # `.*\.` matches the layers_node prefix 
    # layer index start at 0 
    
    # positive match: layer 19, gate module 
    r"+:.*\.18\..*gate.*": {"bits": 4, "group_size": 32},  
    
    # positgive match: layer 20, gate module (prefix defaults to positive if missing)
    r".*\.19\..*gate.*": {"bits": 8, "group_size": 64},  
    
    # negative match: skip layer 21, gate module
    r"-:.*\.20\..*gate.*": {}, 
    
    # negative match: skip all down modules for all layers
    r"-:.*down.*": {},  
 } 

```

### Group Aware Reordering (GAR)

Group Aware Reordering (GAR) is an enhanced activation reordering scheme designed to significantly improve the accuracy of quantized models without incurring additional inference overhead. Unlike traditional activation reordering, GAR restricts permutations to within individual groups or rearrangements of entire groups. This ensures each group's associated scales and zero-points remain efficiently accessible during inference, thereby avoiding any inference-time overhead.

How to enable GAR:

Set the `act_group_aware` parameter to `True` and disable the default activation reordering by setting `desc_act` to `False` in your `QuantizeConfig`. For example:

```python
quant_config = QuantizeConfig(bits=4, group_size=128, act_group_aware=True)
```
